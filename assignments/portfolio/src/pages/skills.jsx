          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>
          Python is my favorite programming language because of its simplicity and versatility. 
          It allows me to write clean, readable code without unnecessary complexity, making it 
          easy to learn and use. Its simple syntax makes problem-solving smoother, and it enables me to focus more on logic rather than 
          struggling with syntax issues. Overall, my opinion of Python is very high.

          <h3>React</h3>
          <p>
          I don’t feel strongly about React one way or another, but I use it when needed. It gets the job done for front-end development, and I work with it when required.

          <h3>JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
          I prefer using JavaScript for backend development rather than front-end. It works well with Node.js, and I find it more useful for handling server-side logic and APIs.

          <h3>SQL</h3>
          <p>
          I wouldn’t say I’m amazing at SQL, but I can do whatever is required. Whether it’s writing queries, managing databases, or handling data retrieval, I can get the job done.
